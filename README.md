## Libraries used
- WhiteBoxEngine (3D Engine made by a professor at ISART Digital: https://github.com/Trizek/WhiteBoxEngine)
- AltMath (Mathematic library made in collaboration with my classmates)

## Commands
You can change the current animation and the speed of the animations using commands in the console
- anim=   : change the animation ("anim=Walk" and "anim=Run")
- speed=  : change the speed of the animations

## WARNING
Due to the engine version used, you can only compile in x86. It also cause some resources parsing problems and sometimes the model won't show up. All you you have to do is close and re-open the application.
